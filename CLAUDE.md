Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

---

## 1. Think Before Coding

> Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- Do not introduce any assumptions that cannot realistically be implemented. Keep all plans and technical choices strictly realistic.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

---

## 2. Simplicity First

> Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: _"Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?"_ If yes, simplify.

---

## 3. Surgical Changes

> Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that **your** changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

**The test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

---

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

> Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- `"Add validation"` → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- `"Fix the bug"` → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- `"Refactor X"` → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

## 5. Teach & Explain (Hands-on Learning)

> Act as an interactive mentor. Explain the mechanics.

For every prompt and task, don't just output code - help the user understand the codebase and architectural changes in detail.

- Break down and teach what the implementation is doing under the hood, with specific emphasis on anything related to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or Generative AI (GenAI).
- Provide concrete, detailed examples to illustrate complex concepts like vector embeddings, semantic search, prompt engineering, or LLM integrations.

---

## 6. Permanent Bug Fixes & Pre-Approval

> No temporary patches. Build robust, approved solutions.

- Do not write quick, temporary "band-aid" patches to bypass a bug.
- Investigate the issue to target the root cause and provide a robust, permanent fix.

**Approval Workflow:** For any bug, draft a clear explanation of what is broken, why it broke, and how you plan to fix it. Present this plan to the user and get explicit approval before making changes to the codebase.

---

## 7. Strict Zero-Cost Policy

> Ensure zero financial overhead.

Do not introduce, use, or recommend any technologies, services, libraries, or deployment strategies that incur monetary costs.

This includes avoiding paid APIs, paid database tiers, premium cloud storage, or hosting platforms with fees. Everything must be 100% free-tier, open-source, or run locally.

---

## 8. Frontend & Design System Guidelines

> Consistently match the design tokens and system aesthetics.

- Strictly follow the design system guidelines and specifications defined in the `./design` directory.
- Avoid using inline CSS styling.
- Maximize the use of Tailwind CSS utility classes for layouts, responsiveness, and frontend UI components.

---

## 9. Project Knowledge Base (`context.md`)

> [`./claude/context.md`](./claude/context.md) is the project's persistent knowledge base - the record of what has been built so far, how it is implemented, and which decisions shaped it. Treat it as required reading and as the destination for every meaningful change.

**Before coding** in response to any prompt:

- Read [`./claude/context.md`](./claude/context.md).
- At minimum, read the **Current State** section (tech stack, architecture, repo layout, build/run/test commands) and the **most recent 2–3 entries in Session History**.
- Use this as the source of truth for what already exists, how it works, and which decisions are locked in. Do not duplicate or contradict prior work without explicit reason.

**After making code, design, or architecture changes** in response to a prompt:

- Append a new entry to **Session History** using the template defined at the top of `context.md`. Record: what was done, files touched (path + create/update/delete + why), decisions made and their rationale, and any open questions or follow-ups.
- Update **Current State** when the stack, architecture, repo layout, or build/run/test commands materially change.
- Update **Key Decisions** when a non-trivial architectural or product decision is made.
- Update **Open Questions / TODOs** as items are added or resolved.
- **Never edit past Session History entries** - the log is append-only. If a prior entry turns out to be wrong, correct it in the new entry rather than rewriting history.

Skip the append only when no code, design, or architecture changed (e.g. a pure clarifying-question turn). When in doubt, append.

---

## 10. Learnings Log (`learnings.md`)

> [`./claude/learnings.md`](./claude/learnings.md) is the user's personal learning journal - the distilled "what / why / how it works under the hood" record of every concept taught while building this project. It pairs with §5 (Teach & Explain): every teaching moment becomes an entry here.

**After every teaching moment** in a response (per §5 - whenever you explain how something works under the hood, the rationale for a technical choice, a non-obvious framework behavior, a RAG/GenAI concept, or a tradeoff):

- Append a new entry to [`./claude/learnings.md`](./claude/learnings.md) capturing the same explanation in durable form.
- Match the existing structure: a `###` heading for the topic (or extend an existing topic's section when the new teaching is a natural continuation), one or more `> Question framing?` lines, followed by prose that explains the mechanics, the _why_, the tradeoffs, and a concrete example where it clarifies.
- Keep it self-contained - a future reader (the user, six months later) should be able to understand the concept without re-reading the surrounding conversation. Avoid references like "as we discussed above" or "in Task 1.4".
- **Never edit past entries** - the log is append-only, same rule as `context.md` Session History. If a prior explanation turns out wrong or incomplete, correct it in a new entry.

Skip the append only when the response contains no real teaching (e.g. a pure code edit with no explanation, or a clarifying question). When in doubt, append.

---

These guidelines are working if: fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes, and the user understands the codebase and RAG/GenAI concepts hands-on without unexpected costs.
